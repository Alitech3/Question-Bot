Cas project to first moderate the Question Game (Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead) then potentially branch out from there.

Run Bot:
python -m disco.cli --config config.json

The command prompt in this folder is used to run the bot easier
However it will need to be modified for whoever downloads this

Command prompt modificatons:
open the properties of the command prompt inside the folder and edit its target to fit your prefences aswell as where you have the file located to (if you dont change the location to where it is on your machine it will not work)
